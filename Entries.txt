Entry 1.
if the JTable thing does not work (adding an event) , then you can always have a menuItem that implements that same thing.

Entry 2.
here's how you implement the add event option
	first you create an object that can hold the 	
			* date of the event
			* The list of the events in that specific date
	second you create an TreeSet that stores the list of Events for all the dates
			if the user chooses the same date twice you just add the event to do to that date by searching that date
	when the user clicks save Events you will write to a dat file all of the objects one by one.
Check the layout in the file layoutEvent.
